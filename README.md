Transfer Learning to detect Pneumonia

In this kernel, I tackled the problem of detecting pneumonia in images using transfer learning.

What is transfer Learning? This is the application of previous knowledge (weights) from pretrained and better models on our dataset.
We employ what has already beenc reated to make our stuff better...instead of starting from scratch.

Please enjoy the kernel. I am going to comment well on it and make it better.

In the future I will try much better models, heavier models to do the same work.

Cheers.
